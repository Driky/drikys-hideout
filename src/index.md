Hello, I'm Cedric "[Driky](https://http://localhost:4001/)" Chatelain.

I'm passionate about **software development**, and trying to be more rigorous in sharing my
insights and collaborating with others. That's why I write articles.

I focus on software craftmanship an DX.

Thus, I've developed expertise in **TypeScript**, **Elixir**, **Vue** ,
**Nuxt**, **Flutter**, **Dart**.
